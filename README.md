# Ballon D'Or Analysis

This repository holds all the code for my side project using clustering to analyze the relative abilities of the 2021 Ballon D'Or candidates.
Soon, I'll add a Github article to talk about my findings and visualizations.

## Files

The "players" folder contains each player's statistics for the season.

In "fbrefmarkdown," I clean and merge the player data into a single dataframe, then do the analysis.

In "pltstuff", I make some plotly radar charts to profile each cluster. These are hosted on my plotly account.

In "fbclust.twb", I make the Tableau visualization of the clusters. It is also hosted online on my Tableau public account.
